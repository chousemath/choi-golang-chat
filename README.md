# Simple Chat Service

> This is a very simple chat service that is meant to be cross-platform, and used only from the terminal / command line. This is mainly just my effort to become more familiar with the Go programming language and its standard library.

# Running the application in development mode

```bash
$ go run main.go
```

# To do list
